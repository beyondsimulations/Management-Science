# Course Policies

## Team Work Guidelines

- Teams of 3-4 students formed in Lecture 1
- All team members must contribute meaningfully
- Peer evaluation forms will be used to assess individual contributions
- Team conflicts should be reported to instructor immediately

## Late Work Policy

- Assignment 1 & 2: -10% per day late (up to 3 days)
- Competition project: No late submissions accepted (real consulting deadline!)
- Extensions granted only for documented emergencies

## Academic Integrity

- Collaboration encouraged within teams, between teams on concepts only
- GitHub Copilot and AI tools encouraged for learning, not for replacing thinking
- Copying solutions from internet or other students prohibited
