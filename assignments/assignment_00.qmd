## Introduction

These assignments are about learning to apply optimization thinking to real problems. Using AI tools is encouraged as long as you understand the code as this mirrors real-world practice where developers use all available tools.

Focus on:

- Understanding the problems
- Applying algorithmic thinking
- Interpreting results
- Making business recommendations

Remember: You're training to be business problem-solvers who can work with data and algorithms. The goal is insight and understanding, not perfect code!

## How Assignments are Graded

**Technical Implementation (50%)**

- Correctness of algorithms
- Code quality and documentation
- Efficiency and scalability
- Additional features

**Analysis & Insights (30%)**

- Problem understanding
- Results interpretation
- Business recommendations

**Communication (20%)**

- Clarity of documentation
- Visualization quality


## Tips for Success

**Using AI Tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)**

- DO use them to understand concepts and debug
- DO use them to learn new Python syntax
- DO use them to improve your code
- ❌ DON'T just copy-paste without understanding
- ❌ DON'T submit code you can't explain, I will know ;)

**Academic Integrity**

- Your code should be your own work
- You must understand everything you submit
- Cite any external sources used

**Start Simple**

- Get a working solution first, then optimize
- Print intermediate results to check your logic

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Forgetting to return to depot in routing
- Not checking schedule validity after changes
- Optimizing forever - "good enough" is often perfect
- Forgetting to answer the business questions

## Submission Requirements

Submit a Jupyter notebook containing:

1. Your code implementations (with comments!)
2. Output showing your code works
3. Visualizations of results
4. Business analysis answers (clearly marked)

**File naming:** `Assignment_01_[GroupNames].ipynb`

## Late Policy

- -10% per day late
- Maximum 3 days late
- Exceptions only for documented emergencies
