# Management Science - Building Your Crystal Ball
#
# # Introduction
#
# Welcome back to Bean Counter, CEO! In the lecture, we saw how Monte
# Carlo simulation helps us make decisions when the future is uncertain.
# Now it’s time to apply these techniques to expand your coffee empire and
# prepare for the TechVenture competition.
#
# **Your CEO Challenge:** Bean Counter Expansion - analyzing single
# locations and portfolios for strategic growth
#
# **Key Skills for Competition:**
#
# -   Simulating uncertain returns
# -   Analyzing risk metrics
# -   Comparing portfolio combinations
# -   Making data-driven recommendations

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# # Section 1 - Modeling Uncertainty with Distributions
#
# Let’s start by modeling uncertain business variables using probability
# distributions.
#
# ## Understanding np.random

# %%
# Example: Daily customer traffic follows a normal distribution
# Historical data shows: mean = 100, std = 20

# Simulate one day
one_day_customers = np.random.normal(100, 20)
print(f"One random day: {one_day_customers:.0f} customers")

# Simulate many days to see the pattern
many_days = np.random.normal(100, 20, size=1000)
print(f"\n1000 days simulation:")
print(f"  Mean: {many_days.mean():.1f} (expected: 100)")
print(f"  Std Dev: {many_days.std():.1f} (expected: 20)")
print(f"  Min: {many_days.min():.0f}, Max: {many_days.max():.0f}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.1 - Simulate Purchase Amounts
#
# Average purchase per customer varies uniformly between €8 and €12.
# Simulate 10,000 purchase amounts.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Simulate 10,000 purchase amounts uniformly distributed between 8 and 12
purchase_amounts =

# Calculate statistics
mean_purchase =
min_purchase =
max_purchase =

# Don't modify below - these test your solution

assert 11 < max_purchase <= 12, f"Max should be ~12, got {max_purchase:.2f}"

# ## Exercise 1.2 - Calculate Probabilities
#
# Using your simulated data from the previous task, calculate key
# probabilities.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Using the many_days array from above (1000 days of customer data)
# Calculate the probability of different scenarios

# Probability of getting more than 120 customers
prob_high =

# Probability of getting fewer than 80 customers
prob_low =

# Probability of being within one std dev of mean (80-120)
prob_normal =

# %%
# Don't modify below
assert 0.10 < prob_high < 0.20, f"High probability should be ~0.16, got {prob_high:.3f}"

# # Conclusion
#
# **Outstanding work, CEO!** You’ve successfully applied Monte Carlo
# simulation to Bean Counter’s expansion strategy and mastered the key
# skills needed for the TechVenture competition:
#
# -   **Simulating uncertain returns** using probability distributions
# -   **Running thousands of scenarios** with Monte Carlo
# -   **Calculating risk metrics** (VaR, Expected Shortfall)
# -   **Comparing portfolio combinations** systematically
# -   **Making data-driven recommendations** with clear justification
#
# When you tackle the TechVenture challenge, apply what you’ve learned at
# Bean Counter:
#
# 1.  **Start Simple:** Get one startup simulation working first
# 2.  **Verify Distributions:** Plot histograms to check your simulations
# 3.  **Calculate All Metrics:** Don’t just look at mean returns
# 4.  **Compare Systematically:** Analyze all 6 pairs
# 5.  **Justify Clearly:** Explain WHY your choice is best
#
# ## Key Differences for Competition
#
# The competition uses:
#
# -   **Investment returns** instead of daily profits
# -   **Different distributions** (some normal, one uniform)
# -   **Larger scale** (€1M investments vs daily operations)
#
# But the approach is identical! Apply what you’ve learned here.
#
# > **Tip**
# >
# > Just as you’ve optimized Bean Counter’s expansion, use scoring
# > functions in the competition to make objective decisions when multiple
# > factors matter. Your journey from Barista Trainee to CEO has prepared
# > you for this!
#
# Good luck in the TechVenture Investment Challenge, CEO!
