# Client Briefing: NurseNext Hospital

## Meet Your Client

**Industry:** Healthcare
**Client Contact:** Dr. Robin Torres, Chief Operating Officer
**Facility:** Medium-sized hospital with 3 departments
**Staff:** 20 nurses, 50 beds, 24/7 operations

## The COO's Challenge

**Dr. Robin Torres, COO of NurseNext Hospital**

*"I became a doctor to help people, but now I spend 8 hours every week manually creating nurse schedules and they're still terrible!*

*The situation is unsustainable:*

- *Massive overtime costs*
- *25% sick leave rate because nurses are exhausted*
- *High turnover, we lose 3-4 experienced nurses annually*
- *Constant complaints about unfair weekend distribution*
- *Last month, 2 nurses quit citing 'burnout and unfair scheduling'*

*The manual process is killing us. I try to be fair, but with 20 nurses, 3 departments, different skill levels, shift preferences, and labor laws... I just can't optimize it all in my head.*

*We need an automated scheduling system that:*

1. *Cuts overtime massively, if possible*
2. *Distributes weekends fairly (the biggest complaint)*
3. *Respects labor laws (consecutive shifts, rest periods)*
4. *Maintains quality of care (right skills at right times)*
5. *Is robust to sick calls (we always have 1-2 nurses out)*

*Can you build this for us? I have data from last month's schedules and our staffing requirements."*

## The Business Context

### Current Situation

**Departments:**

- **Emergency Department (ED):** High-intensity, requires experienced nurses
- **Medical-Surgical (Med-Surg):** General care, moderate intensity
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU):** Critical patients, highest skill requirements

**Shifts (Each 8 hours):**

- **Morning (7:00-15:00):** Highest patient activity
- **Evening (15:00-23:00):** Moderate activity
- **Night (23:00-7:00):** Lower activity but critical monitoring

**Scheduling Horizon:** 1 week (21 shifts total = 7 days × 3 shifts/day)

### Cost Structure

- **Regular wage:** €25/hour (€200 per 8-hour shift)
- **Overtime wage:** €37.50/hour (€300 per overtime shift, 1.5x multiplier)
- **Weekend premium:** +€50 per weekend shift
- **Night premium:** +€30 per night shift
- **Understaffing penalty:** €500 per understaffed shift (patient safety risk)

### Labor Law Constraints

::: {.callout-warning}
## Legal Requirements (Must Comply!)

1. **Maximum consecutive shifts:** 5 days in a row
2. **Minimum rest period:** 11 hours between shifts
3. **Maximum weekly hours:** 48 hours per nurse (6 shifts max)
4. **Weekend work limit:** Maximum 2 weekend days per month
:::

### Fairness Expectations

Nurses' union has negotiated fairness requirements:

- Weekend shifts distributed equally across nurses
- Night shifts distributed equally
- Workload (total hours) balanced within ±10%
- No nurse should work significantly more undesirable shifts than others

## The Data

### Shift Requirements

```{python}
#| eval: true
# Define shift requirements for each department and shift type
# Format: (min_nurses, min_senior_nurses)

shift_requirements = {
    'ED': {
        'Morning': {'min_nurses': 3, 'min_senior': 1},
        'Evening': {'min_nurses': 3, 'min_senior': 1},
        'Night': {'min_nurses': 2, 'min_senior': 1}

        'Evening': {'min_nurses': 2, 'min_senior': 1},
        'Night': {'min_nurses': 2, 'min_senior': 2}
    }
}

# Display requirements

print("=" * 70)
for dept, shifts in shift_requirements.items():
    print(f"\n{dept} Department:")
    for shift, req in shifts.items():
        print(f"  {shift:8} - Min {req['min_nurses']} nurses (at least {req['min_senior']} Senior/Expert)")

# Calculate total weekly demand
total_shifts_needed = 0
for dept in shift_requirements:
    for shift in shift_requirements[dept]:

print(f"Available capacity (20 nurses × 6 shifts max): {20 * 6} shift-slots")
print(f"Capacity margin: {20 * 6 - total_shifts_needed} shift-slots")
```

## Week Structure

```{python}
#| eval: true
# Define the week structure
days_of_week = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
shift_types = ['Morning', 'Evening', 'Night']

# Create a schedule template DataFrame
schedule_template = []
for day_num, day in enumerate(days_of_week):
    for shift in shift_types:
        is_weekend = day in ['Saturday', 'Sunday']
        schedule_template.append({
            'day': day,
            'day_num': day_num,
            'shift': shift,
            'is_weekend': is_weekend,
            'shift_code': f"{day[:3]}_{shift[:3]}"  # e.g., "Mon_Mor"
        })

schedule_template_df = pd.DataFrame(schedule_template)

print("\nWEEK SCHEDULE STRUCTURE (21 shifts total)")
print("=" * 60)
print(schedule_template_df.to_string(index=False))
```

## Minimal Helper Functions

We provide only basic data structures and a validation function. **You must implement the scheduling algorithm yourself.**

```{python}
#| eval: true
def validate_schedule(schedule, nurses_df, shift_requirements):
    """
    Validate a schedule against all constraints.

    Args:
        schedule: Dict or DataFrame representing nurse assignments
                  Format example: {('Monday', 'Morning', 'ED'): [nurse_id1, nurse_id2, ...], ...}
        nurses_df: DataFrame with nurse information
        shift_requirements: Dict with staffing requirements

    Returns:
        dict with validation results and violations
    """
    violations = []
    warnings = []

    # This is a TEMPLATE - YOU need to implement the actual validation logic!
    # Check:
    # 1. All shifts have minimum staff
    # 2. Senior/Expert requirements met
    # 3. No nurse works more than 6 shifts per week
    # 4. No nurse works more than 5 consecutive days
    # 5. Minimum 11 hours rest between shifts
    # 6. Weekend distribution fairness

    print("Validation function is a template - you must implement full logic!")

    return {
        'is_valid': len(violations) == 0,
        'violations': violations,
        'warnings': warnings
    }

def calculate_schedule_cost(schedule, nurses_df):
    """
    Calculate total cost of a schedule.

    Args:
        schedule: Your schedule representation
        nurses_df: DataFrame with nurse information

    Returns:
        dict with cost breakdown
    """
    # Constants
    REGULAR_SHIFT_COST = 200
    OVERTIME_SHIFT_COST = 300  # 1.5x multiplier
    WEEKEND_PREMIUM = 50
    NIGHT_PREMIUM = 30
    UNDERSTAFFING_PENALTY = 500

    # YOU must implement this!
    # Calculate costs based on:
    # - Regular shifts vs overtime (>40 hours/week)
    # - Weekend premiums
    # - Night premiums
    # - Understaffing penalties

    print("Cost calculation function is a template - you must implement!")

    return {

```

## Your Task

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Deliverables

You must develop a scheduling solution that creates a one-week schedule for all 20 nurses and provides:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook with Complete Solution

Your notebook should include:

- **Data exploration:** Insights about current staffing patterns and constraints
- **Algorithm implementation:** Your scheduling approach (construction + improvement)
- **Results:** Complete one-week schedule with all assignments
- **Fairness analysis:** Distribution of weekends, nights, workload across nurses
- **Cost analysis:** Total cost and breakdown
- **Robustness testing:** What-if analysis for 1-2 nurses calling in sick
- **Code quality:** Well-commented, clear, and reproducible

### 2. Presentation (8 minutes maximum)

- **Problem understanding** (1 min): Dr. Torres's challenges in your own words
- **Your approach** (2 min): Algorithm choice, how you handled constraints and fairness
- **Results** (3 min): Schedule visualization, cost savings, fairness metrics
- **Business impact** (1 min): Recommendations for NurseNext, implementation plan
- **Q&A preparation** (1 min): Trade-offs, limitations, next steps

### 3. Key Metrics to Report

- Total weekly cost
- Overtime cost reduction vs. simple greedy solution
- Fairness metrics:
  - Weekend distribution (mean, std, min, max)
  - Night shift distribution
  - Total shifts per nurse
- Constraint compliance (labor law violations: should ideally be ZERO!)
- Robustness: Impact of 1-2 sick nurses
:::

## Constraints and Requirements

::: {.callout-important}
## Hard Constraints (Should Satisfy!)

1. **Shift coverage:** All shifts meet minimum staffing requirements
2. **Skill requirements:** Each shift has required number of Senior/Expert nurses
3. **Maximum shifts:** No nurse works more than 6 shifts per week (48 hours)
4. **Maximum consecutive:** No nurse works more than 5 consecutive days
5. **Minimum rest:** At least 11 hours between shifts (no Evening→Morning or Night→Morning/Evening)
6. **Department assignment:** Nurses only work in their assigned department
7. **Night shift eligibility:** Only nurses with `can_work_night=True` on night shifts

## Soft Constraints (Optimize for Fairness)

1. **Weekend fairness:** Equal distribution of weekend shifts
2. **Night shift fairness:** Equal distribution of night shifts among eligible nurses
3. **Workload balance:** Total shifts per nurse should be within ±1 shift of average
4. **Undesirable shift balance:** Fair distribution of "undesirable" shifts (nights, weekends)
:::

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with constraints:** Get a feasible schedule first, optimize fairness second
2. **Use data structures wisely:** Consider using:
   - Dict: `{(day, shift, dept): [nurse_ids]}`
   - DataFrame: Rows = nurses, Columns = shifts
   - Your own structure!
3. **Fairness is subjective:** Define clear metrics for "fair" distribution
4. **Visualize the schedule:** A Gantt chart or heat map makes patterns obvious
5. **Labor laws are non-negotiable:** Zero violations if possible. Check after every change!
6. **Think like a nurse:** What makes a schedule "good" from their perspective?
   - Predictable patterns
   - Fair weekend distribution
   - No excessive consecutive shifts
7. **Overtime is expensive:** Keeping nurses under 40 hours saves €100/shift!

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Ignoring labor laws:** Legal violations = instant failure in real world!
- **Unfair weekend distribution:** This is nurses' #1 complaint, track it carefully!
- **Not checking 11-hour rest:** Evening→Morning violates rest requirements
- **Forgetting skill requirements:** ICU night needs 2 Senior/Expert nurses!
- **Over-optimization:** A good, fair schedule beats a "perfect" but unfair one
- **No robustness testing:** Real hospitals have sick calls every week!
- **Poor visualization:** Make the schedule easy to read for nurses!

## Data Access

All data is provided in this notebook:

- `nurses_df`: DataFrame with 20 nurses and their attributes
- `shift_requirements`: Dict with staffing requirements by department and shift
- `schedule_template_df`: Week structure (21 shifts)
- Helper templates: `validate_schedule()`, `calculate_schedule_cost()`

**You must implement the full scheduling algorithm and constraint checking logic!**

## Deadline

- **Notebook submission & Presentation:** Lecture 12
- **Good luck, consultants!**
