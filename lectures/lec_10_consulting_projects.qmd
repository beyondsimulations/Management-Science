- **NurseNext:** Healthcare scheduling nightmare  
- **TechMart:** Inventory allocation disaster
- Each group picks **ONE client** to work with
- This is **40% of your final grade**
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
**You're not just students anymore - you're consultants.**

[CEO's Morning Crisis:]{.invert-font}

["We're bleeding money on delivery costs while customers complain about [cold food]{.highlight}! Our 4 drivers just 'wing it' every day. Result? [75% late deliveries]{.highlight}, angry customers, and investors getting nervous."]{.invert-font .fragment}

---

## QuickBite: The Delivery Chaos

[QuickBite's daily logistics nightmare:]{.highlight}

::: {.incremental}
- **120 meal deliveries** across Hamburg every day
- **4 drivers** starting from one central depot
- **Current approach:** Drivers choose routes by "intuition"
- **The damage:** Monthly waste in fuel + penalties
- **Customer complaints:** Up 40% this quarter
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
**The Stakes:** Cut costs AND improve on-time delivery before investors pull funding!
:::

---

## QuickBite: Your Mission

[What you need to solve:]{.highlight}

::: {.incremental}
- **Vehicle Routing Problem** with time windows
- 120 delivery locations across Hamburg
- 4 drivers with capacity constraints
- Time windows for each delivery (violations = penalty)
- **Trade-offs:** Distance vs. punctuality vs. driver workload balance

[COO's Scheduling Crisis:]{.invert-font}

["I spend [8 hours every week]{.highlight} manually scheduling nurses, and they're still terrible! Massive monthly overtime, [25% sick leave]{.highlight} from burnout, nurses quitting citing 'unfair scheduling.'"]{.invert-font .fragment}

## NurseNext: The Burnout Problem

[NurseNext's staffing crisis:]{.highlight}

::: {.incremental}
- **20 nurses** across 3 departments (ED, Med-Surg, ICU)
- **Current system:** Manual scheduling by exhausted COO
- **The damage:** Overtime, 25% sick leave rate
- **Fairness issues:** Unequal weekend distribution
- **Turnover:** Losing 3-4 experienced nurses annually
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
**The Stakes:** Reduce overtime massively AND improve nurse satisfaction or face staffing collapse!
:::

---

## NurseNext: Your Mission

[What you need to solve:]{.highlight}

::: {.incremental}
- **Employee Scheduling** with complex constraints
- Multiple skill levels (Junior, Senior, Specialist) and departments
- Shift patterns: Morning (7-15), Evening (15-23), Night (23-7)
- **Labor law:** Max consecutive shifts, rest periods, weekly hours
- **Fairness:** Weekend equity, workload balance, distribution
- **Robustness:** What happens when nurses call in sick?

[COO's Inventory Paradox:]{.invert-font}

["We have [€10M stuck in inventory]{.highlight}, yet we're constantly out of stock on bestsellers! [20% stockout rate]{.highlight} on popular items while slow-movers occupy our fast warehouse. Black Friday is in 3 weeks!"]{.invert-font .fragment}

## TechMart: The Allocation Disaster

[TechMart's warehouse crisis:]{.highlight}

::: {.incremental}
- **30 electronics SKUs:** Smartphones, laptops, ...

- **Current problem:** Wrong products in wrong warehouses
- **Last Black Friday:** Ran out of top items in Hamburg on Day 1
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
**The Stakes:** Optimize inventory allocation before Black Friday or repeat last year's disaster!
:::

# [Tips for Success]{.flow} {.title}

## Strategic Advice

[How to approach your project:]{.highlight}

::: incremental
1. **Choose your client wisely**
   - Pick based on your team's strengths
2. **Start with data exploration**
   - Understand the data BEFORE coding
3. **Build incrementally**
   - Simple solution first (greedy)
   - Then improve (local search, metaheuristics)
:::

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

[Watch out for these:]{.highlight}

::: incremental
- **Scope creep:** Trying to solve everything perfectly
- **Poor time management:** Coding until the last minute
- **Ignoring business context:** Technical solution without impact
- **Bad visualizations:** Unreadable charts or no visuals
:::

. . .

::: callout-important
Don't build a solution that you can't explain to the client!
:::
