## Context Engineering

Write clear descriptions of what you want:

```python
# Create subplot with 2 rows, 1 column
# Top: line plot of revenue over time
# Bottom: bar chart of profit by quarter
```

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
- **Be specific** in your instructions
- **Review** generated code
- **Test the code** as it might use old syntax
- **Iterate** for better results
- **Force To-Tos** so everything is completed
:::

## Watch Out For

- **Deprecated methods**: `plt.subplot()` vs `plt.subplots()`
- **Missing imports**: Always verify imports are included
- **Wrong assumptions**: Might guess your data structure incorrectly
- **Over-complexity**: Very often suggests unnecessary features

## Foundation Complete!

[Why This Matters?]{.question}

. . .

[You now have a good foundation for data-driven decisions!]{.highlight}

. . .

**Before this introduction:**

- Excel crashes with large datasets
- Manual calculations take hours
- Limited to basic charts
- No way to simulate scenarios

# [What's Next]{.flow} {.title}

## Preview: 4 - Monte Carlo

[Next Session: Modeling Business Uncertainty]{.highlight}

. . .

**We'll combine everything you've learned:**

- NumPy for random number generation
- Visualization for showing probability distributions

. . .

**Real applications:**

- Predict project completion times
- Estimate financial risks
- Make decisions under uncertainty

## The End

[That's it for today!]{.highlight} **Make sure you:**

- [ ] Have completed all the notebooks
- [ ] Check whether you could follow so far
- [ ] Set up Copilot

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Every line of code you write makes you a better programmer.
Every concept you understand makes you a better decision-maker.

## Interesting Literature on Algorithms

- Christian, B., & Griffiths, T. (2016). Algorithms to live by: the computer science of human decisions. First international edition. New York, Henry Holt and Company.[^4]
- Ferguson, T.S. (1989) ‘Who solved the secretary problem?’, Statistical Science, 4(3). doi:10.1214/ss/1177012493.

[^4]: A great inspiration to learn more about Algorithms!

## Books on Programming

- Downey, A. B. (2024). Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist (Third edition). O’Reilly. [Here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/)
- Elter, S. (2021). Schrödinger programmiert Python: Das etwas andere Fachbuch (1. Auflage). Rheinwerk Verlag.

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Think Python is a great book to start with. It's available online for free. Schrödinger Programmiert Python is a great alternative for German students, as it is a very playful introduction to programming with lots of examples.
