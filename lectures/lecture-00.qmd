## Learning Python

- In my experience, the best way to learn is by **doing**!
- Here, we will focus on decision algorithms
- You will start to learn Python by [doing the tutorials]{.highlight}

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Don't worry, I will help you out if you have any questions!

## Difficulty of the Course

## Goals of the Course

## Why Python?

- **Origins**: Conceived in late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language
- **Simple Syntax**: Python’s syntax is mostly straightforward and very easy to learn
- **Versatility**: Used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more
- **Community Support**: A large community of users worldwide and extensive documentation

## Help from AI

- You are [allowed to use AI]{.highlight} in the course, we use it as well (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, LLama3 ...)
- These **tools are great** for learning Python!
- Can help you a lot **to get started** with programming

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
But you should *not* simply use them to *replace* your learning.

# [How to learn programming]{.flow} {.title}

## Our Recommendation

1. [Be present]{.highlight}: Attend the lecture and solve the tutorials
2. [Put in some work]{.highlight}: Repeat code and try to understand it
3. [Do coding]{.highlight}: Run code, play around, modify, and solve

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Great resources to start are books and small challenges. You can find a list of recommendations in the [literature recommendations](../general/literature.qmd).

## Don't give up!

# [Setting up Python]{.flow} {.title}

## Install VS Code

- Download and install from the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Built for **Windows, Linux and Mac**
- Install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension
- [Now you are ready to go!]{.highlight}

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Unsure on how to work with VS Code and notebooks?
Ask me! I'm happy to help you out!
:::

## What is an IDE?

- Integrated Development Environment `=` application
- It allows you to write, run and debug code scripts
- Other IDEs include for example:
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains
  - [Zed](https://zed.dev/)

## Installation of Python with `uv`

- We will use `uv` to install and manage Python versions
- It works on Windows, Mac and Linux
- It helps us to manage packages and virtual environments
- Now, we all [go here](../general/uv.qmd) and install `uv` and Python

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
If the installation does not work, **let me know!**
:::

# [Using Notebooks with uv]{.flow} {.title}

## Quick Check

- Have you installed `uv` and initialized the project?
- Great! Before we continue, check the following:
  - [] You have a folder for the course
  - [] You have initialized `uv` with `uv init` inside the folder
  - [] You can see a file called `pyproject.toml` in the folder

  . . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Something not working yet? Ask me!
:::

## Using Notebooks

- Now we need to add a kernel to our project
- Run `uv add --dev ipykernel` from your terminal
- This allows us to use `uv` Python in notebooks
- Now, install the extension (Jupytext for Notebooks)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=congyiwu.vscode-jupytext]
- Done? Perfect. Now we can start!

## Working with Notebooks

- Now you can download the files from the website
- Just click on one of the sessions and open it
- Select `Python` on the right side
- Download and save the files **to your course folder**
- Open them and select “Open with Jupyter Notebook”

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
That was the hardest part today!

## The End

::: {.callout-note}
**That's it for our introduction!**\
Let's have a short break and then continue.

# [Literature]{.flow} {.title}

## Interesting Literature on Algorithms

- Christian, B., & Griffiths, T. (2016). Algorithms to live by: the computer science of human decisions. First international edition. New York, Henry Holt and Company.[^4]
- Ferguson, T.S. (1989) ‘Who solved the secretary problem?’, Statistical Science, 4(3). doi:10.1214/ss/1177012493.

[^4]: A great inspiration to learn more about Algorithms!


## Books on Programming

- Downey, A. B. (2024). Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist (Third edition). O’Reilly. [Here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/)
- Elter, S. (2021). Schrödinger programmiert Python: Das etwas andere Fachbuch (1. Auflage). Rheinwerk Verlag.

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Think Python is a great book to start with. It's available online for free. Schrödinger Programmiert Python is a great alternative for German students, as it is a very playful introduction to programming with lots of examples.
